    """
    Perform a scan using the AMO delay stage and SXR vitara timing system.

    For this function to interface with the DAQ properly, it must be run from
    the same machine the DAQ session is running from (usually sxr-daq). Also,
    the DAQ must be allocated before the function is run.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : float
        Starting delay for the scan in ns.

    stop : float
        Stopping delay for the scan in ns.
        
    num : int
        Number of steps to take, including the endpoints.

    step_size : float
        Step size to use for the scan.

    events_per_point : int, optional
        Number of daq events to take at each step of the scan.
        
    record : bool, optional
        Record the data as a DAQ run.

    controls : dict, optional
        Dictionary containing the EPICS pvs to record in the DAQ. Has the form:
        {"motor_name" : motor.position}

    wait : int, optional
        The amount of time to wait at each step.

    return_to_start : bool, optional
        Return the vitara and the delay stage to their starting positions.

    delay_const : float, optional
        Scale the delay move delta by this amount.

    Raises
    ------
    InputError
        If neither the number of the steps or the step_size is provided.

    ValueError
        If the step_size provided does not yield an whole number of steps.
